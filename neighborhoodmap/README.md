Udacity Project: Neighborhood Map
=====================================

How to load and view the App
=============================

Or it can be run locally by git clone http://github.com/cmatthey/neighborhoodmap.

Search near by schools, groceries, and parks in my neighborhood.



What the project is about
==========================
The map displays Search near by schools, groceries, and parks.
To display the location of each category, select a category from the dropdown.  

Once you select a category the following happens:

1. Map will display the markers of all the Point of Interests for that category.

2. Click on the Marker will show InfoWindow.

3. Click on a POI below the dropdown in the list view will bounce the Marker.



What I did
